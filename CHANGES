------------------------------

Complete code rewrite
Now based on puremvc
editors UI is fully based on scene2d
switched to new under the hood runtime based on Ashley ECS
Ditched old physics editor
Items now can have optional property boxes
added new physics property box to items
added new polygon property box to items
you can now add and edit new polygon to any item directly from the scene.
coordinates are now in world units (meaning you get to specify how much pixels is in one world unit)
switching between resolutions does not make your scene smaller, but just renders it in current quality
new Guides and Rulers system allows you to be more precise (we ditched, old bounding box for resolution size)
Search box for all resources (not only library items)
Library items are now easier to managed added library button to composite property box
Custom vars dialog now stays on top
works better on small screens
better zooming
Position setting don't break anymore when changing to non orig resolution
Amazing new undo/redo system is almost bugless.
Text items now can be created using text tool. No need to import new fonts, as we use fonts from your system.
Import System is changed, now it works with Drag and Drop, and is more aware of file types, so you don't have to specify.

Overlap2D - 0.0.6 - hotfix
-------------------------------

Physics Editor resizes for small screens
Fixed bug freezing all when middle button is pressed
Fixed many reported crash bugs
9Patch now works good when you scale or set width with pixels, so you can set 9patch sizes more preicesly

You cannot select an item that is not in scope of current opened composite from node view
composite size calculation is wrong when inside items have negative scales
Bug: labels where adding to locked layer by default

5. New 9patch item, 9 patch importing and exporting system, 9 patch resizing for all resolutions, and proper scaling from editor
6. Ctrl+Z is not anymore resulting in reset camera to 0 coordiante
7. Custom Variables system for composite items (check out basic properties panel)
8. Dialogs are now movable only when draging from top
9. repack button now also updates asset list
