------------------------------

Complete code rewrite
Now based on puremvc
editors UI is fully based on scene2d
switched to new under the hood runtime based on Ashley ECS
Ditched old physics editor
Items now can have optional property boxes
added new physics property box to items
added new polygon property box to items
you can now add and edit new polygon to any item directly from the scene.
coordinates are now in world units (meaning you get to specify how much pixels is in one world unit)
switching between resolutions does not make your scene smaller, but just renders it in current quality
new Guides and Rulers system allows you to be more precise (we ditched, old bounding box for resolution size)
Search box for all resources (not only library items)
Library items are now easier to managed added library button to composite property box
Custom vars dialog now stays on top
works better on small screens
better zooming
Position setting don't break anymore when changing to non orig resolution
Amazing new undo/redo system is almost bugless.
Text items now can be created using text tool. No need to import new fonts, as we use fonts from your system.
Import System is changed, now it works with Drag and Drop, and is more aware of file types, so you don't have to specify.
